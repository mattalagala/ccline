1. Added href to logo back to home page. 
2. Changed the front page to only be a single page screen, so that we can use the rest of the pages content as separate pages, like we spoke about on Saturday. 
3. Created separate pages for all the nav bar links. 
    - To make it easier, please just open up the page I created that was assigned to you and input your code in between the section tags. We can talk more about it tomorrow.
    
    <-- Description of your content -->
    <section>

    </section>

4. Had to troubleshoot the JS scripts because I broke it in the midst of making new pages. 
5. If you have custom css, make sure you change the name of it in the style section. Currently its linked to css/agency.css & agency2.css <-- this was my custom css file that I created, I may change it to Matts custom css.
